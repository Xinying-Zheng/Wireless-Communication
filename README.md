# Project of wireless communication

## Introduction

This project collection contains: the computation of ErlangB, doppler shif simulation, QPSK modulation and diversity methods and the simulation of COST-207 typical urban model.

Notice that: the codes here not well structured, used as script. Moreover, the simulation of channel can not  restore complex communication channels.


## Basics

### Prerequisite

These codes finished by MATLAB-2019b. Please download matlab later than this version


attached: link <https://ww2.mathworks.cn/products/matlab.html>

### Installation

After download the setup.exe, you can install the MATLAB by keep clicking "next".

Notice that: (1) you can change the install path and need not concern the setting of path which will finished by setup program.
(2) during the setup process, you can choose some extension packets, but not necessary for this project.

### Configuration

After install, need not do more configurations. It fessibel to change language.

only open the file and click "run".

## Advanced

You can modify the parameters of the code to do some simulations differentlyã€‚

### Clima

This script is a student project which exist bugs and omission. The coding and naming style still need improved.
Thus, these codes for reference only and should not be used in formal occasions.
